The universal selector is used to style every element on a page, it is the star
* and is often used in computer science to mean all.
Element selector is used to select elements of a certain type and is applied
using an element name.
Class selectors use class names in HTML via the class attribute for a style
element using the dot(.).
Id selectors allow developers to define style rules for a specific element by
calling its unique ID by using the # sign.

The reason for choosing one selector over another quit honestly Im not
really sure at this point.

I chose colors of the 1960s, color one hollyhock which is similar to
PALEVIOLETRED #DB7093, color two Shale which is similar to SLATEGRAY,
#778899, RGB (119, 136, 153, and color three YELLOW MAGNOLIA similar to Gold,
#FFD700, RGB(255,215,0). I was born in 1957 and really don't remember some of
these colors. In fact I like these colors for some of my present day decor.
