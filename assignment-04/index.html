    <h1>Sand Dollars</h1>
    <h2>Cheryl Lehman</h2>
  <hr />
<p>Treasured bits from beneath the sea,<br/>
Could they be underwater currency?!<br/>
Star shapes have blessed their outer canvas.<br/>
Were they used as exchange in Atlantis?!</p>

<p>Long lost, buried without discourses,<br/>
Washed ashore by unearthly forces.<br/>
The moon beckons them to their seaside grave,<br/>
Out in the world for humans to crave.</p>

<p>Exposed to elements outside the ocean realm<br/>
Their beautiful parts are given to overwhelm.<br/>
Meaning to overcome the human heart,<br/>
Hoping to find them whole and not apart.</p>
