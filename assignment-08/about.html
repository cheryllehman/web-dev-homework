    <p>My instructable is about preserving fall leaves. I choose this because,
      I use leaves in my monoprinting to add texture and content to my
      printmaking. I found the glycerin method works best, as it preserves the
      leaves like leather.</p>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>Glycerin</td>
          <td>Water</td>
          <td>Flat pan or disposable plates</td>
          <td>A weight or something to keep leaves submerged
          Leaves</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>Leaves<td>
          <td>Wax paper</td>
          <td>Thin towel or paper</td>
          <td>Iron</td>
          <td>Ironing board</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
        <td>Fresh leaves that have not dried out</td>
        <td>Paper towels</td>
        <td>Microwave</td>
        <td>Acrylic spray from a craft store</td>
