      <h2>How to Preserve Leaves: Glycerin Method</h>
  <p>One method of leaf preservation is to put them into a glycerin/water solution.
  This will preserve your leaves yet leave them relatively flexible.
  This preserving method works because the natural moisture present in the leaves
  is replaced by the glycerin solution, maintaining the leaf’s texture and form.

  What You Need:</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Glycerin</li>
  <li>Water</li>
  <li>Flat pan or disposable plates</li>
  <li>A weight or something to keep leaves submerged
  Leaves</li>

  <p>What You Do:

  Mix the glycerin and water so that it is one part glycerin and two parts water. You only need enough to submerge the leaves — about one cup.
  Pour the solution into a flat pan, place the leaves in the solution, and then put the weight on the leaves to keep them submerged. (Tip: try using two Styrofoam or other disposable plates. Put leaves and enough glycerin solution to just lightly cover the leaves in the bottom of one plate. Then put the other plate on top of the leaves and solution. Now you can put a weight of your choosing on the top plate without getting the weight in the solution.)
  Keep the leaves submerged in the solution for 2-6 days.
  Dry the leaves gently with a paper towel. They should feel soft and pliable.</p>

  <h3>Method 2 How to Preserve Leaves: Wax Paper Pressing Method</h3>
  <p>One of the most common ways to preserve leaves is by pressing them between
  wax paper.

   What You Need:</p>
  <oi>
  <li>Leaves</li>
  <li>Wax paper</li>
  <li>Thin towel or paper</li>
  <li>Iron</li>
  <li>Ironing board</li>

  <p>What You Do:

  Place a leaf between two pieces of wax paper.
  Put a towel or a piece of thick paper over the wax paper.
  Press on the towel or paper with a warm iron to seal the wax sheets together.
  This takes about 2-5 minutes on each side, depending on how moist the leaf is.
  Once you have finished one side, flip the leaf over and do the other side.
  Cut around the leaf, leaving a small margin of wax paper to ensure that it will
  stay sealed.Rather than cutting out the leaves, you may want to try to peel the
  wax paper off the leaves, leaving a coat of wax behind to protect the leaves.
  Try this on one leaf first to see if this method works for you.</p>

  <h4> Method 4 How to Preserve Leaves: Microwave Method</h4>
  <p>Thanks to everyday technology, there is another way to preserve autumn leaves.
  This method requires using a microwave.

  What You Need:</p>
  <oi>
  <li>Fresh leaves that have not dried out</li>
  <li>Paper towels</li>
  <li>Microwave</li>
  <li>Acrylic spray from a craft store</li>

  <p>What You Do:

  Arrange the leaves on top of two paper towels. Lay another towel over the leaves
  to cover them.Microwave the leaves for 30-180 seconds. Be very attentive and
  careful. Leaves that are cooked in the microwave too long can catch fire. The
  drier the leaves, the less time they will need. Leaves that curl after removal
  from the microwave have not been in long enough. Leaves that are scorched have
  been in there too long. Only dry them for a few seconds at a time. Let the
  leaves sit for a day or two and then finish by spraying an acrylic sealant on
  both sides of the leaves.Compare the texture and color of the leaves after using
  the different preserving methods. Did one method work well for a particular tree
  species, but another method work better for a different tree species? What do you
  conclude about what happens to the leaves during the different preserving
  processes? If you’d like, use a tree identification guide for help identify
  the leaves of different species. This is how to preserve leaves.</p>
