The difference between system font, web font, and web-safe font is system
fonts are the fonts already installed on your computer, while a web font is
a specially tuned font for use on websites using the CSS font-face declaration.
Web fonts are custom fonts hosted on a server. They do not have to be
available on the user's device to appear, but require certain elements to
get called up correctly. Web-safe fonts are fonts that developers can count
on being available by the system which include font families that both Windows
and Mac should have.
