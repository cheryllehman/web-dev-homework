    <h1>Defining Moments/Godwinks</h1>
    <h1>By Cheryl Lehman</h1>

    <div class="text"

<p>Defining moments, we all have them or will have them. The day you turned right
instead of left or vice versa and ran into an old friend. Maybe a few words out
of a book you read that struck a nerve or a song on the radio. Maybe it was a
brush with death that made you realize that life is too short to live in an
unhappy or abusive relationship. A moment of ahah telling you to close a door,
to open a different way of living. It may be the day you realize there is
something more powerful than ourselves is directing us to live and love in
another way. Sometimes we choose to not heed these moments and continue on
the path we are on, but another opportunity will come along that may be a
little more severe than the circumstance that presented itself earlier.
Life has a way of pursuing us until we listen. Some of us it only takes
once to get it, some it takes several hard knocks or sweet kisses of
opportunity to make a different choice. Some it may take a lifetime of
unhappiness that leads to addiction and maybe the meeting of their own
mortality at some point in life's journey. Our parents death, a sibling
dying too young, or a close friend that you never got to say goodbye too.</p>
