<p>My interest in art started in my teens with photography when I purchased my
first 35 mm camera. I always wanted to be able to paint what I saw through the
camera lens onto canvas, I began in my twenties with a drawing on the right
side of the brain class which led me to painting in acrylics. Once I had my
children though there wasn’t enough time in the day to follow my dream of being
a artist until I was into my fifties. It was when I was forced into early
retirement that I found myself registering for art and writing courses at the
University of Montana and I have been enjoying every moment of this adventure,
from learning ceramics to a love of printmaking. Art has been the realization of
the unanswered question of life’s meaning forme. I find great satisfaction
recreating nature, admiring nature and recognizing its true meaning to our
survival. I believe without nature there could be no us. I have a great
appreciation for wildlife's ability to survive without the comforts we as
humans have become accustomed to. Along with the beauty of the outside world
I see the cold harsh brutality of it that is not even questioned by animals,
“It is what it is, survival of the fittest!” I want to express this to the
world in my artwork. With the use of color, content, and texture in my
printmaking or painting I hope to express the existence of nature’s value
to our environment and existence. My work focuses on fauna and flora of
the West expressing my relationship to growing up in Montana.
