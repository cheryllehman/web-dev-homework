I used myself I'm feeling a bit imaginary right now.

Display: inline rule forces elements to act like inline elements which only take as much horizontal space as needed and ignores width properties. Inline does not force new lines and flows with new content on the screen. inline also cannot change the vertical top/bottom distance between elements. Inline block removes new lines which are inherent in block elements and also forces elements to respect margin and vertical spacing rules or properties.

I'm totally confused, at first I tried to do exactly what you did and my result
turned out nothing like yours. Next I used the books example and still was unsuccessful in creating what I wanted. I emailed you last week but, didn't
hear back from you. I hope you're not sick.
I gave everything my best try and have spent many hours on this.
Thanks Cheryl
