A main document can have one main <head> and several sub headings. The main document has one  <body> element.
The head states what is in the body.
The body plays the role of containing all the information that will show for the viewer.
Structural markup describes not the physical appearance of the document but the logical properties of its parts.
Semantic markup is HTML that introduces meaning to the web page rather than just presentation. For example, a <p> tag indicates that the enclosed text is a paragraph.
