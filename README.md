shows. Also entry forms for the Missoula Fair.
Example of text is plain text, text area, password, place holder, size, and value.(<p> Net ID: <input type="text" name="name" id="test-text"/></p>) Selection examples are option and value.(<p><select name="home_state"><option value="AL">Alabama</option>) Examples of button inputs are upload button, image button, and submit button.(<button><image src=" ./images/github-logo.png"alt-"Github Logo" width="50" />Push to Github/button>)

My work cycle for this assignment was a lot more successful and I was able to figure things out easier than previous assignments.
